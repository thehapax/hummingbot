Make sure you give permissions to **View** and **Trade**, and enter your 2FA code. 

!!! warning "API key permissions"
    We recommend using only **"trade"** enabled API keys; enabling **"withdraw", "transfer", or the equivalent** is unnecessary for current Hummingbot strategies. In the event that for BTSE  **View** and **Trade** permissions are insufficient, select all 5 Key Restriction options for hummingbot trading as shown in the image.

Once you pass the authentication, youâ€™ve created a new API Key!

Your API Secret will be displayed on the screen. Make sure you store your API Secret somewhere secure, and do not share it with anyone.

!!! warning
    If you lose your Secret Key, you can delete the API and create a new one. However, it will be impossible to reuse the same API.
